          Honoré Daumier is known for being one of the first great French caricaturists in the mid-19th century.
          Also a talented sculptor and painter, his works reveal a keen observation of the human condition
          and social issues of his time: poverty, injustices, political maneuvers, bigotry... nothing escaped him.
          <br><br>
          Charles Baudelaire said of him: <em>"one of the most important men, I will not say only of caricature,
          but also of modern art"</em>.
          <br><br>
          The building behind his bust, now turned into an Intercontinental hotel, was once a great Marseille hospital.
          Built starting in 1753, it replaced the old Hôtel-Dieu of 1593, the first hospital with exclusively secular staff in France.
          It served for teaching medical and paramedical professions until 2006.

    Yes, Hannibal, little Honoré Daumier also has some statues in his likeness. He became
    a great Marseille artist who, in his time, revolutionized the art of caricature. If you feel like it,
    don't hesitate to learn more about this man: you will discover caricatures that will remind you of the
    sacred and revolutionary fire that animated him during our conversations at the table.
  
    His statue stands in front of the Intercontinental Hotel. One day soon, it will become a casino but in our
    time, as you know, it was a hospital. The first secular hospital in the region, meaning with
    non-religious staff.
    
    Speaking of religion... it's time for you to go to the Church of Accoules,
    located a few dozen meters to your left.
 
    Sound, Hannibal... sound is of capital importance to me.
    The bells of this church rhythm the city, but also time. To successfully calibrate a
    temporal passage from my position, I need to be able to anticipate the regular sounds that these
    bell towers produce in the era where you are.
   
    Can you tell me how many bells are still there today?
