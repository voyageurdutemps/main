        In order to house and gather the beggars and vagrants, who were numerous at the beginning of the 17th century following the royal edict on the confinement of the poor, the Marseille city council decided on December 8, 1622, to confine the poor natives of Marseille to a proper place. 
        It was not until 1671 that construction of the building began under the direction of the architect Pierre Puget, a local boy who became one of Louis XIV's favorites. 
        This building, a sort of prison for the poor, also served as an asylum for the elderly and destitute until the 19th century. 
        In the 1940s and 1950s, nearly 150 families lived there, helped by around thirty Little Sisters of the Poor. 
        In 1962, the building was closed and then listed. A series of restoration campaigns were launched to restore it. 
        Today, it houses several cultural structures, including the Museum of Mediterranean Archaeology — free, like many Marseille museums.

A Well, of course! That's surely what my friend wanted to show me during the Great War. 
We were looking for underground passages to make our leaps in time, and Marseille is indeed equipped with them. 
In Antiquity as in the Middle Ages, running water was rare and depended on aqueducts, often built by the Romans. 
But here in Marseille, rainwater was mainly stored in cisterns dug into the rock. 
This one is one of the few to remain from that period. As for the Hospice de la Vieille Charité opposite you—its name is misleading. 
It was not dedicated to charity... but to confinement. 
The poor, beggars, and undocumented immigrants were gathered there in the 17th and 18th centuries, forced to work in exchange for a bed and a little food. Funny charity... 

You've now collected enough clues to try your luck at the cryptex. 
But be careful. 
The algorithm, like the cryptex, leaves no room for error. 
If you make a mistake... the mechanism will close forever. You'll have to wait for another passerby to try their luck.
