          Aristotle tells in "The Constitution of the Massaliotes" that Captain Protis,
          a Greek from Phocaea, was one day invited to the banquet organized by Chief Nanos, who ruled
          over the Provençal coast at that time. By chance, Nanos was celebrating his daughter's wedding
          that evening, Gyptis. The local tradition wanted the future bride to choose her husband during the banquet
          among the suitors, by giving him a cup. Gyptis preferred to offer it to Protis. King Nanos
          then offered his daughter in marriage, with a dowry of land at the location of the current ancient port
          of Massalia (Marseille). This founding myth reflects a historical reality: the Greeks, a people of
          sailors, formed alliances with coastal peoples. Greek cities on the French coast
          include Agde, Nice, Olbia, Toulon, Antibes...

    Three towers, that's correct! I'm relieved that my fate is in your hands...
    You are standing in front of the East entrance gate of the city of Marseille, built during the
    Hellenistic period, in the 3rd century BC. In the 21st century, metal ship structures will be
    installed at the location where the port was in antiquity. These are reconstructions of
    ships found during excavations in Marseille at Place Jules-Verne. A ship was indeed found in the
    port, but it was much larger, and Roman. It is said that this is where Protis and Gyptis
    founded the city, 2600 years ago, but it's probably a legend... Let's continue.
    Go north for 200 m, to find the Hôtel de Cabre. Today, it is located on Grand Rue.
    But before, it was in another street. I need to know the name of this old
    street. Could you give it to me?
