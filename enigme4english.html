          This house takes its name from its former owner, Bastien Cabre. The almost 500-year-old building has the remarkable distinction of having been moved in one piece during the summer of 1954 at a 90-degree angle, to be placed in line with Grand Rue, where it forms the corner of Bonneterie Street. The names of both streets appear on the same wall of the house, one engraved in stone and the other on a simple sign. A contradiction that sums up its location before its rotation and relocation. Its imposing façade and mullioned windows allowed it to be listed as a Historic Monument by decree of May 2, 1941. The rest of the building had already been listed since November 1926. The other unique feature of this house, miraculously preserved since the 16th century, is that it escaped the Nazis' orders to raze the Old Port during the Occupation in 1943. Indeed, during the winter of 1943, the Nazi occupiers took advantage of the help of the French government to implement a major restructuring plan for Marseille, considered a haven for resistance fighters, Jews, Roma, and criminals of all kinds. This plan already existed in the 1920s, but it was not until Nazi support that it was implemented. More than 20,000 Marseillais were expropriated, 1,642 deported and murdered, and 1,500 buildings destroyed.

Honoré Daumier was indeed 70 years old on the day of his death, and had become almost blind, a shame for one of the greatest caricaturists of his time! I remember his frankness and his undeniable talent as a draftsman during my visit to Marseille under Napoleon III. His life is a true novel, do not hesitate to find out more about this man when you have the opportunity Annibale. His statue is in front of the Hôtel Dieu, which as you know was one of the first secular hospitals in France. Imagine that one day this hospital will become a luxury hotel. Speaking of hotels, cross the street and continue east for about a hundred paces. You will find the Hôtel de Cabre, one of the oldest houses in the city, which is often under construction. Did you know that before the war, it was located on the Saint-Augustin pass? What is the name of the street that replaced the pass?
